# BookCloud

**Overview:**

Itâ€™s is an android based application which will contribute to ease
communication between peoples who wants to buy and sell books.


**Motivation and Objectives:**

During the project we observed that most of the Bangladeshi are facing problems to exchange books in digital area because of these following factors:
-	Lack of awareness and knowledge about rights
-	Difficult to communicate between buyers and sellers
-	Lack of a central database
-	Not having smooth transaction between buyers and sellers

The primary questions arising from the above factors include:
-	How to exchange the book easily? 
-	How people are come in one platform?
-	How to communicate to each other?

Based on the factors and the importance of exchange book our projects are summarized as follows:
People can make offer for rent and exchange their books as their demand. They have their own account by which they can manage their books. They have an access to books list for renting or buying and it can be sorted according to choice list or by search they can get an access to book list on a specific area and it can be list view and map view. We use map in our project and it helps people a lot they have an access to list of their university tagged books which are uploaded for rent or sale. People also can request books on the apps for rent. They can chat with each other for rent or sale purpose.

**The Problem:**

Most of the cases, people cannot exchange book for lack of suitable platform and lake of community problem. They cannot find the right people to exchange or sell the book and sometimes people cannot find the right book which he want. Sometimes people think about security problem to share their information. Bangladesh is poor country and many people have no ability to buy book always so they think about exchange but they cannot find the right place and people


**Audience:**
Our project presents important findings for various reasons and to several audiences:

-	Individuals interested to exchange book like rent and buy
- People of different communities having same interests on books 
-	Student, Teacher and Writer to make the platform better.
